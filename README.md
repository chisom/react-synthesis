# Synthesis

Synthesis is an open-source content mangement framework built on the modern web with React, Redux, Express, and Mongo. It is designed to be pragmatic and extensible, so it's easy to create new features and plugins around Synthesis.

## Pull Requests

We'd love your help making Synthesis better! Feel free to create issues or pull requests to start discussions.

// We require all authors sign our [Contributor License Agreement](https://www.nylas.com/cla.html) when submitting pull requests. (It's similar to other projects, like NodeJS or Meteor.)

// ## Security

// For the sake of simplicity and setup speed, the development VM does not include any authentication or permission. For developing with sensitive data, we encourage developers to add their own protection, such as only running Nylas on a local machine or behind a controlled firewall.
// Note that passwords and OAuth tokens are stored unencrypted in the local MySQL data store on disk. This is intentional, for the same reason as above.
